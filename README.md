# Wine-Classification-Dashboard---Tableau

This is a Wine Classification Dashboard built using Tableau, utilizing the UCI Wine dataset. The dashboard provides an interactive visual interface for exploring and analyzing the Wine dataset, as well as visualizing and analyzing the results of machine learning models for wine classification.

## Dataset
The UCI Wine dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset that contains 178 samples of wine, each with 13 numerical features (e.g. alcohol content, malic acid, etc.) and 3 classes representing the cultivar of the wine. The dataset is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning and is a popular benchmark dataset.

## Features
The Wine Classification Dashboard on Tableau offers the following features:

Data visualization: Interactive visualizations of the Wine dataset, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, to explore the distribution and relationships of the features.
Model results visualization: Visualization of the results of machine learning models, such as confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves, to assess the performance of the models.
Predictions: Ability to input custom data and get predictions from the trained models for wine classification.
Model comparison: Comparison of multiple trained models to visually identify the best performing model for wine classification.
Dynamic filtering: Interactive filters to dynamically explore and analyze the Wine dataset based on different criteria.

## Usage
The Wine Classification Dashboard on Tableau provides an intuitive interface for exploring and analyzing the Wine dataset, visualizing and analyzing the results of machine learning models, and making predictions. Here are the main steps to use the dashboard:

Explore Data: Use the visualizations in the dashboard to gain insights into the distribution and relationships of the features in the Wine dataset. Interact with the filters to dynamically filter the data based on different criteria.

Visualize Model Results: Visualize the results of machine learning models, such as confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves, to assess the performance of the models. Compare the performance of different models visually to select the best performing model.

Make Predictions: Input custom data in the dashboard and select a trained model to get predictions for wine classification. Visualize the predicted results on the dashboard.

## Model Training
The Wine Classification Dashboard on Tableau is designed to visualize the results of pre-trained machine learning models. Model training is typically done using a separate tool or programming language outside of Tableau, such as Python or R, and the trained model results can be imported into Tableau for visualization and analysis.
